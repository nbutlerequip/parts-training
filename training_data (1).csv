February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,1,Walk-in customer at the counter. You recognize them as someone who runs a small excavation company with a few machines.,I need oil filter 48138563 for my TV380.,What are the hours is the most valuable question in parts sales. It takes 3 seconds to ask and can turn a 24 dollar sale into a 510 dollar sale. But only if you ask BEFORE suggesting the kit.,"Sure thing. Hey, we've got a 500-hour service kit that's actually a better deal than buying filters separate. Includes the oil, hydraulic fluid, all the filters, grease, everything. Want me to price that out?",better,"Right product, wrong approach. You might be right about the kit, but you don't know if they need it. If they're at 200 hours, you just tried to sell them something they won't need for months. Now they feel like you're pushing product instead of helping. Ask first, then suggest.","Got it. Before I grab that, what are the hours on the machine? If you're coming up on 500, might make sense to look at the full service kit. Runs about 510 but you get all 17 parts and saves you about 57 bucks over buying everything separate.",best,"This is the move. Asking about hours isn't pushy. It's helpful. If they're at 200 hours, you grab the filter and move on. If they're at 480, you just saved them a trip back and made a 510 dollar sale instead of 24. The question costs you nothing and changes everything.","Yeah, let me grab that. I'll pull an air filter too since you'll probably need that soon anyway. Save you a trip.",bad,"Don't assume what they need. Maybe they just did the air filter last week. Now you've grabbed something they don't want, and they have to tell you to put it back. That's awkward for everyone. Ask what they need instead of deciding for them.","Yep, got those. 23.68. Just the one?",good,You got the sale but left money on the table. Nothing wrong with this because the customer got what they asked for. But you don't know if they're at 480 hours and about to need 510 in parts anyway. One question could've changed a 24 dollar ticket into a 510 dollar ticket.
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,2,Phone call. Customer sounds like they're on a job site. You can hear equipment in the background.,I need cutting edge 76082416 for my 621G.,Cutting edges without hardware is like selling a tire without lug nuts. The customer might not think about it but you should.,199.91. What size bucket is that for? Want to make sure I'm pulling the right one.,bad,"Wrong question. The part number already tells you what you need. Asking about bucket size sounds like you don't know your inventory. When a customer gives you a part number, trust it and focus on what else they might need to complete the job.","199.91. I'll grab the bolts and nuts too, you'll need 16 of each to mount it. That's another 71 for the hardware.",better,"Right idea, but you assumed instead of asking. Maybe they've got hardware from the old edge. Maybe they bought extra last time. When you add things without asking, customers feel like you're padding the ticket. Ask first and then they know you're helping, not upselling.","199.91 for the edge. You good on mounting hardware, or you need bolts and nuts too? Takes 16 of each to install, runs about 71 bucks for the set.",best,This is how you build the order. You're not pushing something they don't need. You're making sure they have everything to finish the job. Most customers don't think about hardware until they're staring at the edge wondering how to attach it. You just saved them a trip.,"Got it, 199.91. Want me to set it aside?",good,"You processed the order but missed an easy add-on. Cutting edges need bolts and nuts to install. 16 of each, about 71 bucks in hardware. If they get home and realize they don't have hardware, that's a wasted trip or a delayed install. You could've saved them the headache."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,3,Counter customer. Contractor you've seen a few times who runs a paving crew.,"I need bucket teeth for my 580. The standard ones, 442689A1.","Bucket teeth without pins and retainers is a half-finished sale. These go together every time. If you're not asking, you're leaving money on the table and making the customer come back.","442689A1, 13.21 each. How many you need?",good,"You got the teeth count, but stopped there. Teeth need pins and retainers to install. If they're replacing teeth, there's a good chance the pins are worn too. You answered the question but didn't help them finish the job.","13.21 each. Good teeth, we sell a ton of them. How many you need?",bad,"Commentary about the product doesn't help them. They already know what they want. Your job is to make sure they have everything to finish the job, not to validate their choice. Focus on what else they might need.","I'll get you set up. How many teeth, and I'll grab pins and retainers to match. You'll want to replace those at the same time.",better,"You're right that they go together, but you decided for them. Maybe they just did pins last month. When you assume, customers either feel pushed or have to awkwardly tell you to put stuff back. Ask the question and let them decide.","How many you need? And you good on pins and retainers, or should I grab those too? Most guys replace them together since you've already got it apart.",best,"That's the complete question. You're not assuming they need pins. You're asking. And the phrase since you've already got it apart explains WHY it makes sense. Now they're thinking about the whole job, not just the part they came in for."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,4,Walk-in customer you haven't seen before.,I just need fuel filter 84534796 for my TR320. That's all I need.,"When a customer says that's all I need, they're usually thinking about one problem. A good question can help them think about the whole job without being pushy.",Sure. You'll probably want the fuel water separator too. Most people do those at the same time. It's 31.72.,better,"Probably right, but you'll probably want sounds like a sales pitch. The customer already said that's all I need and pushing back immediately feels like you're not listening. Ask what they're doing, then suggest based on their answer.","35.77. Quick question though, you doing a full fuel system service or just swapping this one filter? If you're doing both, the fuel water separator is 31.72 and they're usually done together.",best,"You're not pushing. You're clarifying. Just this filter might mean they forgot about the separator, or it might mean they just did it. Now you know, and you've either helped them avoid a second trip or confirmed they're all set.","No problem, 35.77. I'll grab that for you.",good,You respected what they asked for. Nothing wrong with that. But just the fuel filter often means they're doing a partial service. One question might reveal they need the fuel water separator too or that they're actually due for a full service.,That's all you need? Just the one filter?,bad,"Repeating their words back as a question sounds like you're doubting them. It puts them on the defensive. If you want to know more about what they're doing, ask a real question about the job instead of a skeptical echo of what they just said."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,5,Phone call. Fleet customer you know well. They have several 580SN backhoes.,I need V-belt 90420971 for one of our 580s.,"580s have two belts that share the same labor. Fan and alternator plus A/C. When one goes, the other usually isn't far behind. Asking about both makes sense because you're saving them from doing the job twice.",31.28. You need anything else for that machine while I've got your account up?,bad,Too vague. Anything else puts the burden on them to think of what they might need. You know the 580 has two belts. A specific question about the A/C belt is more helpful than making them guess what else they might need.,I'll grab that plus the A/C belt since they usually go together on the 580. That's 31.28 plus 18.43.,better,"Right thinking, but you added it without asking. Fleet customers especially don't like surprises on their tickets. They might have just done the A/C belt last month. Ask first, then you're helping instead of assuming.","That's the fan belt, 31.28. A/C belt still good, or you want to do both while you're in there? A/C belt is 18.43 and most guys do them together since it's the same labor.",best,This is thinking like a technician. You're not pushing a product. You're pointing out that doing one belt means they're already in there. The second belt costs 18 bucks but saves a whole second job. That's real value.,"Got it, fan belt, 31.28. Want me to set it aside?",good,"You identified the part correctly but missed the natural follow-up. The 580SN has two belts, and if one failed, the other has the same hours on it. You could've saved them a second repair by asking about the A/C belt."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,6,Customer responded to your hours question. Their TV380 is at 480 hours.,"Yeah, about 480 hours. Why?","When they ask why after you ask about hours, that's your opening. They're curious. Connect the dots clearly from hours to service interval to kit value.","Oh, just checking. Let me grab that filter for you.",bad,You asked the question but didn't do anything with the answer. 480 hours is 20 away from the 500-hour service. You had the perfect setup and walked away from it. The customer even asked why and they were interested.,"Just curious. The 500-hour service is coming up. Something to think about. Anyway, here's your filter.",bad,"You mentioned the service but didn't offer anything. Something to think about puts it back on them with no information. If you're going to bring it up, bring the solution too. Otherwise you're just creating a question you're not answering.","You're getting close to the 500-hour service. We've got a kit for that, want me to price it out?",better,"You made the connection but stayed vague. Price it out means they have to wait while you look it up, and they still don't know what's in it. Know your kits. Give them the number, tell them what's included, and make it easy to say yes.","480 means you're about 20 hours from the 500-hour service. Full kit is 510.72 and covers everything. Oil filter, fuel filter, fuel water separator, primary and secondary air, hydraulic filter, cab filter, plus all the fluids. Saves about 57 bucks over buying it all separate. Want me to put that together?",best,You connected the dots. Hours leads to service interval leads to what's in the kit leads to what they save. The customer now has everything they need to make a decision. You're not pushing. You're informing.
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,7,Counter customer looking at a hydraulic filter in their hand.,How much is this? The 47710533?,"Price questions are a chance to learn more. Don't just answer. Find out what they're working on. You might have a better solution, or they might need more than they think.","71.47. That's for the TV380 and TR series. Good filter, we sell a lot of those.",better,"You added some context, which is nice, but you didn't learn anything. You're still just processing a transaction. The customer might be doing a full service and need five other filters. You won't know unless you ask.",71.47. Want me to ring it up?,bad,"You rushed to close on a single filter. No discovery, no building the order, no relationship. This customer might have three machines and do all their services at once, but you'll never know because you didn't ask.",71.47. What machine is this going in? Want to make sure you've got the right one since we've got a few different hydraulic filters that look similar.,best,"Now you're helping. You're verifying the part AND learning about their equipment. Once you know the machine, you can check hours, suggest related filters, or mention the service kit. The price question became a conversation.",71.47. Just the one?,good,"You answered the question. Nothing wrong with that. But you don't know what machine it's for, how many hours, or if they're doing a full service. Just the one is better than nothing, but a real question would tell you more."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,8,Phone call. Customer sounds like they're reading from a list.,"I need oil filter 48138563, fuel filter 84534796, and air filter 84217229.","When a customer has a list, they've thought about what they need but they might not have thought about everything. Look for what's missing and ask about it.","Got those. That's oil, fuel, and primary air. You doing a full service? Just want to make sure you're not missing the fuel water separator or the hydraulic filter. Those usually go with these three.",best,"You recognized the pattern. Three filters means partial service, but why partial? Maybe they forgot the others. Maybe they just did them. Now you know, and you've either completed their list or confirmed they're set. Either way, you helped.","Alright, let me read that back. 48138563, 84534796, 84217229. That's 104.18 total. Want me to set them aside?",bad,You repeated the numbers back like a drive-through order. The customer doesn't need you to read their own list to them. They need you to think about whether the list is complete. You added nothing.,"Got it. 23.68, 35.77, and 44.73. I'll get those together for you. Anything else?",good,You processed the list. Fine. But three filters from a service list usually means there's more. Fuel water separator? Hydraulic filter? Anything else is weak because they already gave you their list. Ask about something specific.,Got it. You'll want the fuel water separator too since it goes with the fuel filter. And probably the hydraulic filter if you're doing a service. Want me to add those?,better,"Right instinct, but you'll want and probably sound like you're telling them what to do. They had a list so respect that. Ask if they need the others instead of assuming they forgot."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,9,Counter customer. He's been looking at the battery display for a minute.,What do you have for a 580SN? Battery's dead.,"January is peak battery season with an index of 170. When someone's buying a battery, they're often dealing with cold weather issues. This is a chance to ask about related problems.",BMF31GW fits the 580SN. 154.22. Want me to grab one?,good,You matched the battery correctly. But a dead battery in winter often means other cold-weather issues. Did they check the alternator? How old are the wiper blades? You answered the question without understanding the situation.,"BMF31GW, 154.22. How old was the one that died? If it was only a couple years, might be worth checking the alternator since sometimes that's what kills them. Also, how are your wiper blades holding up in this weather?",best,You're thinking beyond the battery. A two-year-old battery dying might mean alternator problems. And wipers are a natural cold-weather add-on. You're not pushing product. You're helping them think about the whole machine in winter conditions.,154.22 for the BMF31GW. I'd grab some wiper blades while you're here too since you'll want fresh ones in this weather. 28.36 for the blades.,better,"Wipers are a reasonable suggestion in winter, but you didn't connect it to anything. You'll want fresh ones assumes theirs are bad. Ask how they're holding up first and then you're helping, not just adding to the ticket.","BMF31GW is what you need. 154.22. Good battery, we sell a lot of them for the 580s.",bad,We sell a lot of them doesn't help the customer. They don't care what other people buy. You matched the part and added nothing. This customer has a machine with a dead battery in winter. There's more to talk about.
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,10,Customer's been on the phone with you for a few minutes. You've quoted them filters totaling 207 dollars.,Can you do any better on that price?,"Price objections aren't always about price. Sometimes they're about value. Before you discount, make sure they understand what they're getting. And look for ways to add value instead of cutting margin.",That's already pretty competitive for OEM parts. Can't go much lower than that.,good,"You held the line, which is fine. But you didn't explore why they're asking or offer alternatives. Can you do better might mean they're comparing to aftermarket, or they're buying more than you know. Find out before you shut the door.","On individual filters it's tough to move much. But here's the thing. The full 500-hour kit is 510.72 and includes all those filters plus the secondary air, cab filter, and all the fluids. That's 17 parts and saves you about 57 bucks over buying everything separate. Depends on what you're trying to do.",best,"You redirected to value instead of caving on price. The kit isn't just a discount. It's a better solution. And depends on what you're trying to do invites them to tell you more about their needs. Now you're having a conversation, not a negotiation.",Let me see what I can do... I can probably take 10% off. That'd be 186.30.,bad,You jumped straight to discount without understanding the objection. Maybe they wanted to know if there's a better package deal. Maybe they're comparing to aftermarket. Now you've cut margin and learned nothing.,What were you hoping to spend? I can see what I can work out.,better,"At least you're asking questions, but what were you hoping to spend puts you in a weak position. Now you're negotiating against a number they make up. Better to understand what they're comparing against or what's driving the hesitation."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,11,Phone call. Customer's comparing your price to online.,I can get this hydraulic filter for 60 bucks online. You're at 71.47.,"Online price comparisons are about risk and convenience, not just dollars. Don't bash the competition. Highlight what they get from you that they can't get from a website.",What website is that? I want to see if it's the same part number.,good,"You're checking if it's apples to apples, which is smart. Aftermarket filters often have different numbers. But this feels like you're trying to catch them in something. Frame it as making sure they're comparing the same part, not like you're suspicious.",We can't really match online prices. They've got different overhead than we do.,bad,You gave up without making a case. The customer called you instead of just ordering online and that means something. They want a reason to buy local. You didn't give them one.,"I can probably get close to that if you're buying a few things. What else do you need? If you're doing a service, the kit price is better than buying separate.",better,"You're looking for a way to earn the business without just cutting margin. But starting with I can probably get close signals you'll negotiate. Lead with value first, then talk about ways to make the numbers work.","That might be right, but here's the thing. If that filter's wrong or doesn't show up, you're waiting another week with a machine down. I've got it here, I can verify it fits your machine, and if there's ever a problem you're dealing with me, not a website. Want me to grab it?",best,"You didn't attack the online price. You highlighted the risk and the relationship. Dealing with me, not a website makes it personal. And ending with want me to grab it assumes the sale without being pushy."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,12,You've explained the TV380 kit options. Customer seems interested.,"Yeah, that makes sense. Let me think about it.","Let me think about it often means they need a reason to decide now, or they have a question they haven't asked. Don't push but don't just let them walk either.",Tell you what. I can set one aside and hold it until tomorrow if you want to think it over. That way it's here when you're ready.,better,"You've given them a soft commitment without pressure. Not bad. But you still don't know what they're thinking about. If they have a question, they're leaving without an answer.","Totally understand. It's a good chunk of money. When you're ready, just give us a call.",good,"Sympathetic, but you've basically ended the conversation. When you're ready could be never. You don't know why they're hesitating, and you didn't try to find out.",No problem. We're here til 5 if you decide you want it.,bad,You let them off the hook with no follow-up. Let me think about it is often I have a question I haven't asked or I need a reason to do this today. You didn't try to find out which.,Sure. Is there something specific you're weighing? Sometimes there's a question I can answer that makes the decision easier.,best,You're not pushing. You're inviting them to share what's holding them back. Maybe it's budget. Maybe they're not sure they need the full kit. Maybe they want to check with their partner. Now you can actually help them decide.
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,13,Counter customer. You've rung up their order and they're about to pay.,"Alright, what's the total?","The transaction isn't over until they're out the door. The paying moment is a chance to ask about other machines or upcoming work. Not to sell more, but to stay connected.",162.64. Thanks for coming in.,bad,"Thanks for coming in ends the conversation with nothing learned. You don't know what else they run, when they'll be back, or what projects they have coming. Every transaction is a chance to build the relationship.",162.64. Cash or card?,good,"You completed the transaction. That's fine. But this customer might have other machines, or a big job coming up, or a buddy who needs parts. You'll never know because you didn't ask.","162.64. Hey, before I ring you out, this the only machine you're running, or you got others coming up on service? Just want to make sure you're set.",best,"Natural, not pushy. You're not trying to add to this ticket. You're learning about their operation. If they have another machine at 450 hours, you've just planted the seed for the next sale.","162.64. Oh hey, we've got a special running on air filters if you need any for your other equipment.",better,"You tried to extend the sale, which is good instinct. But special running sounds like a generic pitch, and you don't know if they have other equipment. Ask about their operation first, then offer relevant stuff."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,14,Phone call. Customer mentions something in passing.,...and we just picked up two new TR340s last month.,"When a customer mentions new equipment, that's gold. New machines mean future service, and you want to be their parts source from day one. Don't let it pass without acknowledging it.",Nice. So what can I help you with today?,bad,You heard new equipment and ignored it. Two new TR340s is thousands of dollars in future parts business. You should be excited about that and showing them you want to earn it.,"Oh nice. Those take the same oil filter as the TV380 actually, the 48138563. Good to know for when you need it.",good,You added some value by connecting it to parts knowledge. But you didn't capture the serial numbers or offer to prepare for their service. You treated it as trivia instead of an opportunity.,"Two new TR340s? That's great, congrats. Hey, if you want, shoot me the serial numbers and I'll pull up the filter specs. That way I can make sure we're stocked for your first service. What are the hours on them now?",best,"You showed interest, asked for specifics, and offered to prepare for their future needs. This is how you become their go-to source. They'll remember that you cared about their new equipment before they even needed parts.",That's great. TR340 is a solid machine. Let me know when you need parts for those.,better,"You acknowledged it, which is good. But let me know when you need parts is passive. You're waiting for them to come to you instead of setting yourself up as their parts source now."
February 2026,1,Sales Skills,Ask questions before suggesting. Build the order by understanding what they actually need.,15,Counter customer. Regular guy who usually just buys one or two things.,I need a track roller for my TR320. Part number 47378992.,"Track rollers don't usually fail alone. When one goes, the others have the same hours. And if they're doing rollers, the idler and sprocket are worth asking about.","47378992, that's 236.34. Just the one?",good,"You confirmed the part and quantity. Fine. But track rollers wear together. If one failed, the others are probably close behind. Just the one doesn't explore whether they should be doing more.",236.34 for the roller. How many you replacing? And how's the idler and sprocket looking? Those usually wear at the same rate. Might make sense to do them together while you're in there.,best,"You're thinking like a technician. Undercarriage components wear together, and the labor to replace them is significant. Asking about all three isn't upselling. It's helping them avoid doing the same job twice.",236.34. Those are good rollers. Need anything else?,bad,"Need anything else is lazy. You know undercarriage parts wear together. You should be asking about idlers and sprockets specifically, not putting the burden on them to think of what they might need.",You'll probably want to do more than one since they wear together. How many track rollers does the TR320 have?,better,"Right thinking, but you'll probably want sounds like you're telling them what to do. And asking how many rollers the machine has is something you should know. Ask how many they're replacing, not how many exist."
February 2026,2,Customer Care,Find solutions when you don't have the answer. Take ownership of the customer's problem.,1,Phone call. Customer sounds stressed. You can hear urgency in their voice.,I need hydraulic filter 84196445 for my 621G. Machine is down and I've got a job today.,We don't have it is never the end of the conversation. Check other branches before you say anything else. A customer with a machine down will remember who found the part and who made them figure it out themselves.,"Yeah, those have been tough to keep in stock lately. 621Gs really go through hydraulic filters. Best I can do is get it here by tomorrow morning.",better,"You explained why you don't have it, but the customer doesn't care why. They care about getting their machine running. Explanations don't solve problems. Solutions do. Check other branches before you start explaining.","We're out here, but hold on. Let me check the other branches. Dublin's got 2 in stock. That's about 30 minutes from you. If you can head that way, I'll call right now and have it sitting at the counter when you walk in. What's the name on the account?",best,"This is taking care of the customer. You didn't have it, but you found it. You didn't make them call around. You checked for them. You didn't just give them a branch name. You offered to call ahead. That's the difference between sorry, can't help and actually solving their problem.","I don't have it here. You could try calling Dublin or Zanesville, they might have one.",bad,"You made them do your job. You have F7. You can see what every branch has in 10 seconds. Making the customer call around feels like you're passing them off. Check for them, find it for them, offer to call ahead.","Let me check... yeah, we're out. I can order it and have it here tomorrow morning by 10. Want me to do that?",good,"You offered a solution, but not the right one. Tomorrow doesn't help when the machine's down today. Before you offer tomorrow, check if there's a way to get it to them faster. The customer didn't call to place an order. They called because they need help."
February 2026,2,Customer Care,Find solutions when you don't have the answer. Take ownership of the customer's problem.,2,Continuation. The customer from the last scenario is frustrated and about to give up.,"You know what, nevermind. I'll just try somewhere else.","When a customer says I'll try somewhere else, you've got one more chance. Don't beg but make it easy for them to come back if they can't find it.","Okay, sorry I couldn't help. Good luck.",bad,"You let them go with nothing. They might not find it anywhere, and now they have no reason to call you back. You've lost the sale AND the relationship. One more sentence could have left the door open.",I understand. We should have more in stock next week if you want to check back.,good,"You're looking ahead, but they need it today. Next week doesn't help them right now, and they probably won't remember to call back. Focus on helping them today or making it personal enough they'll remember you.","Alright. If you can't find it, give us a call back and we'll figure something out.",better,"Better than nothing. You left the door open. But give us a call back is impersonal. Call me back with your name and direct line is much stronger. Make it about you, not us.","Hey, before you go, if you can't find it, call me back directly. I'm [your name] at extension [number]. I can usually track things down faster than other dealers because I'll check every branch we have. Seriously, call me if you strike out.",best,"You gave them a lifeline. They might find it somewhere else and that's fine. But if they don't, they know exactly who to call and that you'll actually try. That personal connection might save the sale, and it definitely builds the relationship."

Customer's been waiting on a part.,I ordered a hydraulic pump two weeks ago and nobody's called me. What's going on?,"When a customer has to call to check on their order, you've already failed once. Don't make it worse by being defensive. Own it, find out what's happening, and give them a specific next step.","I'm sorry. That's on us. Let me pull it up and see exactly where it is. If it's stuck somewhere, I'll find out why and call you back today with an answer. What's the best number to reach you?",best,"You took ownership without making excuses. You committed to a specific action (calling back today) and asked for their contact. Now they know someone is actually working on their problem, not just looking at a screen and shrugging.",It shows backordered. Let me see if I can find out more and give you a call back.,better,"You're offering to look into it, which is good. But let me see if I can is weak. Commit to calling them back with an answer, and give them a timeframe. I'll call you by end of day is much stronger than let me see.","Let me look that up... okay, it shows backordered. Should be here next week. Someone should have called you.",bad,Someone should have called you throws your coworkers under the bus and doesn't help the customer. They don't care whose fault it is. They care about when they're getting their part. Own it and give them specifics.,"Yeah, that part's been on backorder. Supply chain issues. They're affecting everyone. Hopefully next week.",good,"You explained the situation, but hopefully isn't a commitment. The customer doesn't care about supply chain issues. They care about when they're getting their part. Get specific, and commit to following up."

Take ownership of the customer's problem.,4,Phone rings while you're in the middle of helping someone at the counter.,[Phone rings],Both customers deserve respect. The phone customer called for help. The counter customer was here first. Handle both without making either feel like a burden.,"[Answer phone] Parts, hold please. [Put on hold immediately, turn back to counter customer]",good,"You acknowledged the phone, which is better than voicemail. But you didn't give them any information or choice. They're just on hold wondering if anyone remembers them. A few more seconds to explain goes a long way.","[Let phone go to voicemail, finish with counter customer]",better,"Reasonable choice. The counter customer was here first. But the phone customer might have an urgent need, and voicemail feels like being ignored. At least acknowledging the phone shows you care about everyone.","[Answer phone] Parts, what do you need? [Start helping phone customer while counter customer waits]",bad,You just told the person in front of you that the phone is more important. The counter customer was here first and now they're standing there watching you help someone else. That's a good way to lose the customer who made the effort to come in.,"[To counter customer] Give me one second. [Answer phone] Parts, this is [name]. I've got someone at the counter, can I call you back in about 2 minutes, or would you rather hold?",best,You acknowledged both customers. The phone customer knows they're not forgotten and gets to choose. The counter customer sees you're professional and organized. Two minutes is specific enough to be believable.

Let's make this quick and get you what you need. What can I help you with?,best,"Short, sincere, action-oriented. You acknowledged the problem without making excuses, and you committed to making up for it. Let's make this quick shows you value their time.","5 minutes? That's not that long. Anyway, what do you need?",bad,"You just told the customer their frustration isn't valid. Even if you think 5 minutes is reasonable, dismissing their feelings guarantees they'll remember this call badly. Apologize and move on.",Sorry about that. We're really busy today. What do you need?,better,"You apologized, which is right. But we're really busy sounds like an excuse, and it implies their call isn't as important as everything else going on. Just acknowledge and move forward.","Yeah, sorry. We're short-staffed. What can I help you with?",good,"You acknowledged it, but short-staffed is another excuse. The customer doesn't care about your staffing problems. They care about being helped now. Focus on them, not on why things aren't working."

They look frustrated before they even say anything.,"Last time I was here, you guys gave me the wrong hydraulic filter. Had to make a second trip.","Past mistakes are chances to show you're different. Don't defend what happened. Acknowledge it, apologize, and prove this time will be better.",I'm sorry that happened. That shouldn't have occurred. What do you need today? I'll verify it against your serial number before you leave so we get it right this time.,best,You apologized without excuses. Then you offered a concrete action to prevent it from happening again. Now they know you're taking it seriously and that you'll personally make sure it's right.,I apologize. Let me look up what happened and make sure we get it right this time.,better,"Good instinct to look up the history. But they're here for a new part, not to relitigate the old order.

Our system can be confusing sometimes. What do you need today?",good,"You acknowledged the frustration but blamed the system. The customer doesn't care whose fault it is. Take ownership, commit to doing better, and prove it with your actions today.",Sorry about that. That was before my time here. What do you need today?,bad,"Before my time distances yourself from the problem, but the customer doesn't care who made the mistake. They care that it was made. You're all one team to them.

Everything okay? You still need them?",best,"Proactive and personal. You're not pressuring them. You're checking in. If they forgot, you just reminded them. If something changed, you found out before it sat there for a month. Either way, you showed you're paying attention.",[Make a note to call them tomorrow if they haven't picked up],better,"Better than doing nothing, but why wait? They've already waited 5 days. Call now. The longer you wait, the more likely they've found another solution or forgotten about the order entirely.",[Ask a coworker if they know anything about the order],good,"You're trying to get context, which is reasonable. But your coworker probably doesn't know either. Just call the customer. They can tell you directly what's going on. Don't complicate a simple situation.",[Leave it on the shelf. They'll pick it up when they're ready],bad,"That order might sit there until it gets put back. Meanwhile, you don't know if they found the parts elsewhere, forgot about the order, or had an issue. A 30-second call could save the sale and show you're paying attention."

It's leaking pretty bad.,"When a customer doesn't have a part number, don't make them feel stupid. They know their machine is broken. They just need help finding the right part. That's your job.","Okay, do you have the part number? Can't really look it up without that.",bad,You just told them they can't get help without information they already said they don't have. They called you because they need help figuring it out. Work with what they know.,Those hoses are kind of tricky. Can you bring the machine in so we can look at it?,good,"Sometimes that's the right answer, but it should be the last resort. The machine is leaking. They might not want to drive it. Try to figure it out over the phone first. Bring it in feels like giving up.",What's the serial number on the machine? I can look up the hose diagram and figure out which one you need.,better,"Good instinct. Serial number gets you to the parts breakdown. But some customers don't know their serial number off the top of their head. Start with model, then ask for serial if you need it. Don't create a dead end.","No problem, we can figure it out. What model backhoe is it? And can you tell me more about where the hose is, like what does it connect to? If you can send me a picture of the hose or the tag on it, that would help too.",best,"You took the problem on. You asked for what they CAN tell you: model, location, visual description. Offering to look at a picture shows you'll work with whatever they've got. You're solving the problem with them, not making them solve it alone."

The SK210?,"When you don't know something, don't guess and don't make the customer feel like they've asked a weird question. Find the answer. That's what builds trust.",I'm not sure. You might want to check your operator's manual or call Kobelco directly.,better,"Honest that you don't know, but you pushed the work back to them. They came to you for help. Try to find the answer yourself before sending them elsewhere.",We sell a lot of that oil for all kinds of machines. It should be fine.,good,"We sell a lot of it isn't the same as it's correct for your machine. Volume doesn't equal compatibility. You're guessing based on popularity, not specs. Verify before you recommend.","Good question. Let me verify that. The SK210 might have specific requirements. Give me a minute to check the specs, or I can call our Kobelco contact if it's not in the system.",best,"You admitted you don't know without making it weird, and you committed to finding out. Checking specs or calling a contact shows you'll get the real answer. That's more valuable than a guess.",I think so? Most hydraulic oil is pretty universal. It should work.,bad,"I think so means you don't know. If they put the wrong fluid in and damage the machine, they'll remember you said it was fine. Don't guess on fluid compatibility.

That seems really high. Are you sure that's right?,"Price questions can feel like attacks, but they're usually just confusion or comparison. Don't get defensive. Verify and explain.","I can check, but that sounds right for the 621G hydraulic filter. It's a bigger filter than most.",better,You offered to verify and gave some context. But you didn't ask what they were comparing against. Understanding their expectation helps you address the real concern.,"Yeah, that's what it costs. It's a big filter for the wheel loaders.",bad,You got defensive instead of helpful. That's what it costs shuts down the conversation. Maybe they're comparing to a different part. Maybe they saw an old price. Help them understand.,"Let me double-check that for you. I want to make sure I quoted the right part. You said 84196445 for the 621G, right? Yeah, that's 100.45. It's one of the larger hydraulic filters. Was there a different price you were expecting?",best,"You verified the part, confirmed the price, and then opened the door for them to explain what they're comparing against. Maybe they saw an aftermarket price. Maybe they have an old quote. Now you can have a real conversation.",Where did you see a different price? Online parts aren't always the same quality.,good,"You're looking for context, which is good, but aren't always the same quality sounds defensive. Ask what they're comparing to before you start defending OEM quality. You might be solving the wrong problem."

Or I can have it ready first thing at 7:30 tomorrow. Would that work?",good,You couldn't do it yourself but you tried to find alternatives. That's better than just saying no. But I can't stay late tonight might sound like the customer's problem isn't important enough. Be careful with the wording.,"Tell you what. I'll set it aside and wait for you. If you're running late, just call and let me know. What's the name for the order?",best,You went the extra mile. Ten minutes of your time might mean this customer comes to you for years. You showed them they matter more than the clock. That's how you build loyalty.,I can set it aside and leave it with the front office. They're here until 5:30. You could grab it there. Would that work?,better,"You found a creative solution that doesn't require you to stay late. Not as strong as waiting yourself, but you still solved their problem. That's taking care of the customer."

You're offering to help with more. But you didn't acknowledge that they've been gone. Need anything else is what you say to any customer. This one deserves recognition.,"73344267, that's 87.58. Cash or card?",bad,You processed the transaction and learned nothing. This customer used to be a regular and disappeared for 6 months. You don't know why they left or why they're back. You missed a chance to rebuild the relationship.,"87.58. Hey, good to see you. It's been a while. How's everything going with the equipment? You still running the 580 and the TR320?",best,"You acknowledged the gap without making it weird, and you showed you remember them. Still running the 580 tells them you know their operation.

It's not the same brand as what I usually get. Is it the same stuff?,"Product concerns need reassurance, not dismissal. They're worried they might damage their machine. Take it seriously and explain clearly.",It's all the same. You're fine.,bad,"You dismissed their concern. Maybe you're right, but they're still worried. You're fine doesn't explain anything. It just tells them to stop asking questions. They might trust you less now, not more.",What brand were you using before? Let me check if we still have any of that.,good,"You're trying to help by finding the old brand, but that might not be necessary. Explain that the specs are the same first. If they still want the old brand, then you can look. Don't make more work before you've addressed the concern.","Good question. It's the same weight oil, 15W-40, which is what matters for your machine. The brand changed but the specs are identical. It'll perform the same. If you have any issues at all, bring it back and we'll make it right.",best,"You acknowledged the concern, explained why it's okay, and offered a guarantee. Now they understand AND they know you'll stand behind it. That's how you turn a worry into trust.","Yeah, we switched brands a few months ago. It's the same spec though, you're good to use it.",better,"You explained what changed, which helps. But you're good to use it is still pretty casual for someone who's worried about their engine.

I'll make sure you're taken care of.",best,"Now they have a name. Next time they call, they can ask for you. And I'll make sure you're taken care of tells them you're personally invested.
