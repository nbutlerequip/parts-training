February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,1,Customer at counter,"I just need an oil filter for my TV380.","The question 'What are the hours on the machine?' tells you if they're near a service interval. At 480 hours, the 500-hour service is coming — that's when mentioning a filter kit makes sense.","Got it. $18.50. Need anything else?",good,"Quick and efficient — many customers appreciate this. The opportunity is that 'anything else' rarely gets a yes. A specific question about hours or the job they're doing often uncovers more.","Sure thing. What are the hours on the machine?",best,"This question gives you context. If they're at 480 hours, you know the 500-hour service is coming and can mention the full filter kit. Your suggestion becomes helpful information, not a random upsell.","Got it. We have a 500-hour service kit if you're due for one.",better,"Good product knowledge — kits are often the better value. Asking about hours first makes this land better because you'll know if they actually need it.","Oil filter, air filter, and fuel filter usually go together. Want all three?",good,"True — these often go together. Without knowing the hours or what service they're doing, it's a bit of a guess. They might have just done air and fuel last month."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,2,Phone call,"I need a fuel filter for my 580 Super N.","'Is this part of a full service?' takes three seconds and tells you whether they need one filter or a complete kit. It's not pushy — you're asking about their plan.","I've got that in stock. $32.50. Want me to set it aside?",good,"You confirmed availability and price quickly. Solid response. If they're doing a full service, a quick question could have turned this into a bigger order.","Got it. Is this part of a full service, or just the fuel filter?",best,"This question tells you the scope. Full service means they probably need oil filter, air filter, maybe hydraulic. Just fuel filter means they know exactly what they want. Either way, you can help better.","Sure. That machine takes a water separator too — want me to add it?",better,"Good product knowledge — water separator is related. Asking about the full service first helps you know if there's even more they need beyond just those two items.","Let me get the part number and I'll have it ready.",good,"Efficient — you're moving to action. A quick question about what service they're doing might reveal they need more, but this works if they're in a hurry."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,3,Counter sale,"I need hydraulic oil for my skid steer.","'Topping off or doing a full change?' is a simple question that changes everything. Topping off is 2-3 gallons. A full change is 5+ gallons and probably needs a filter.","What model? I'll make sure you get the right spec.",better,"Model is important for getting the right hydraulic oil. You could add 'are you topping off or changing it out?' to also understand the scope.","Are you topping it off, or doing a full change?",best,"This question tells you the quantity and whether they might need a filter. A full change without a filter doesn't make much sense — you're helping them think through the job.","We've got AW32 and AW46. Which weight does your machine take?",good,"Good product knowledge — you know the common weights. If they're not sure, asking about the model gets you there faster.","How many gallons do you need?",good,"Practical question if they know exactly what they want. Asking about topping off vs. full change tells you quantity AND whether they need a filter."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,4,Phone call,"Do you have air filters for a Case CX210?","Excavators have two air filters — primary (outer) and secondary (inner). Asking which one prevents the 'I got the wrong filter' callback.","Yes, we stock those. Which one do you need — inner, outer, or both?",best,"You confirmed availability and clarified which filters. This prevents them from showing up for 'the air filter' when there are actually two.","Yes. Most people do both at once. Want me to quote the pair?",better,"Good suggestion — they often go together. Asking which one they need first is slightly better because maybe they just did the inner last month.","Let me check... yes, we have those. $45 for the primary.",good,"You assumed the primary filter. If that's what they need, great. If they needed the secondary or both, they'll have to clarify.","Yes. How many machines are you ordering for?",good,"Good question if they have a fleet. You still need to clarify inner, outer, or both before you can quote accurately."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,5,Customer at counter,"I need wiper blades for my excavator.","Simple items like wiper blades are easy to get incomplete. 'One side or both?' takes two seconds and catches the orders where they actually need a pair.","What model excavator?",good,"Model gets you to the right blades. Adding 'one side or both?' makes sure you quote the full order.","Sure. What model, and are you replacing one or both sides?",best,"Two questions, one sentence. You get the model AND find out if it's one blade or two. Efficient and complete.","Sure. We've got OEM and aftermarket — any preference?",good,"OEM vs. aftermarket is worth discussing, but you need the model first and should ask about quantity.","Got it. I'll look those up — give me the model number.",good,"You're ready to help. Adding 'one side or both?' while you look it up gets you the complete order."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,6,Phone call,"I need to order filters for our dozers.","Fleet orders can be stock replenishment or for scheduled services. Knowing which helps you make sure they get everything they need.","Sure. What models, and which filters — oil, fuel, air, hydraulic?",better,"You're gathering the specifics. Good approach. Asking if it's for scheduled services might reveal they need complete kits for specific machines.","Got it. Are you stocking up, or do you have services coming due?",best,"This tells you how to approach the order. Stocking up = what do they usually keep on hand. Services coming due = what do specific machines need right now.","I can pull up your last order and we can go from there.",good,"Order history is useful for repeat customers. Their needs might have changed — new machines, sold machines — so it's a starting point, not the final answer.","Let me grab a pen. What's the first model?",good,"You're ready to take the order. Understanding the purpose first — stocking vs. specific services — helps you ask the right follow-up questions."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,7,Counter sale,"I need a battery for my skid steer.","Batteries are straightforward, but there are sometimes choices — standard vs. AGM, different CCA ratings. Model number gets you to the right options.","What model skid steer?",better,"Model is essential — it tells you the battery group size and CCA requirement. Good first question.","What model? And do you want standard or AGM? AGM holds up better if the machine sits.",best,"You're getting the model AND educating them on options. AGM batteries are better for machines that don't run every day — that's useful information.","Sure. We've got a few options. What CCA rating do you need?",good,"CCA is important for cold weather starting. Not everyone knows their CCA requirement — model number makes it easier to look up.","Those are in the back. Let me check what we've got.",good,"You're ready to help. Getting the model first ensures you're looking for the right battery."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,8,Regular customer on phone,"Hey, I need grease for the excavator. The usual stuff.","Regulars make it easy to assume, but 'the usual' can be risky. A quick confirmation — product and quantity — prevents wrong orders.","Got it. I'll have it ready for pickup.",good,"This feels efficient with regulars. The risk is if you grab the wrong product or quantity. Quick confirmation protects both of you.","Sure. That's the 251H EP grease, right? How many tubes?",best,"You're confirming product AND quantity. Even with regulars, this takes five seconds and prevents errors. They'll appreciate that you double-checked.","Same as last time? I think that was a case of 10.",better,"You're using order history, which is helpful. Confirming the specific product name adds certainty.","Let me pull up your account and see what you usually get.",good,"Account history is useful. If you remember what they usually order, confirming directly is faster."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,9,Phone call,"I need coolant for my dozer.","Coolant types matter — OAT, IAT, HOAT don't mix well. Model number tells you the spec and prevents a bad mix.","What model dozer? I'll make sure you get the right type.",best,"This is the key question. Different machines require different coolant specs. Model tells you exactly what they need — no guessing.","We've got the Case extended-life coolant. How many gallons?",better,"If they're a Case customer, this is probably right. Confirming the model first makes sure you're not making assumptions.","What color coolant is in there now?",good,"Color can be a clue, but it's not reliable — different brands use different colors for similar formulas. Model is more definitive.","How many gallons do you need?",good,"Quantity is useful, but you need to know the type first. Model tells you the spec."
February 2026,1,Cross-Selling Basics,Ask about the job before suggesting items,10,Counter sale,"I need a couple quarts of hydraulic oil.","Hydraulic oil has different weights and specs. A quick 'what machine?' ensures they get the right product.","What machine is it for? I want to make sure it's the right spec.",best,"Different machines need different hydraulic specs. This takes a few seconds and ensures they get what their machine actually needs.","AW32 or AW46?",better,"These are the two most common weights. If they're not sure, machine model gets you the answer.","Quarts are on aisle 3. Let me know if you need help.",good,"Quick service if they know what they need. If they grab the wrong spec, it could cause issues. A quick model check prevents that.","Sure. Are you topping off, or is it low for some reason?",good,"If it's low, that's worth mentioning — could be a leak. The spec question (what machine) is more important to get right first."
February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,11,Counter sale,"I need a cutting edge for my 621G loader.","Cutting edges need hardware to install — bolts, nuts, and usually end bits at the corners. Asking if they need hardware prevents a second trip.","Got it. Do you need the mounting hardware and end bits, or just the edge?",best,"This covers everything they might need for the job. Maybe they have hardware, maybe they don't. Now you both know.","Sure. Standard or heavy-duty? Depends on what you're pushing.",better,"Good question — edge type matters for the application. Add the hardware question and you've got the complete order.","I'll grab that. $285 for the edge.",good,"Quick response with pricing. If they need hardware too, they might realize it later and have to come back.","Let me check what we have in stock for that model.",good,"Stock check is useful. Before you look it up, asking about hardware and end bits helps you quote everything at once."
February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,12,Phone call,"I need a water pump for my 450 dozer.","When the water pump is replaced, the thermostat and gaskets are usually done at the same time — they're cheap insurance when the cooling system is already apart.","Got it. Want me to include the thermostat and gaskets? Most people do those at the same time.",best,"You're suggesting items that make sense for the job. A $40 thermostat is cheap insurance when the system is already apart.","Sure. $285 and it's usually 2-3 days. Want me to order it?",good,"Price and lead time are helpful. Mentioning the related items before they order could save them a second call.","I can get that. New or reman? Reman is about 40% less.",better,"Good to offer the choice — reman pumps are a real option. Adding the thermostat and gasket question covers the whole job.","What's the serial number? I want to make sure I order the right one.",good,"Serial number is important for accuracy. While you're confirming details, ask about the related items."
February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,13,Counter sale,"I need bucket teeth for my excavator.","Bucket teeth attach with pins and retainers. Not everyone remembers to order them. Asking saves them a trip back.","What size machine? And do you need pins and retainers, or just teeth?",best,"Size tells you the tooth style. The hardware question catches the incomplete order before they leave.","What size excavator?",good,"Size is essential for getting the right teeth. Adding the hardware question completes the order.","Standard or heavy-duty? Depends on what you're digging in.",better,"Application matters for tooth selection. You still need machine size and should ask about pins and retainers.","How many teeth do you need?",good,"Quantity is useful, but machine size determines tooth style. Ask about hardware too."
February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,14,Phone call,"I need a starter for my skid steer.","Starters come in new and reman. It's worth offering the choice — reman is significantly less and works fine for most applications.","What model? And do you want new or remanufactured? Reman is about half the price.",best,"You're getting the model AND presenting options. Reman starters are a real choice and the savings matter.","What's the model number?",good,"Model gets you to the right starter. Mentioning the new vs. reman option gives them a choice.","Sure. Let me see what we have in stock.",good,"Stock check is useful, but you need the model first. And offering new vs. reman gives them options.","Got it. We usually have those in stock.

February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,15,Counter sale,"I need brake pads for our F550.","Brakes are a system — if the pads are worn, the rotors might be too. Asking if they need rotors isn't upselling, it's making sure the job gets done right.","Front, rear, or both? And do you need rotors too, or just pads?",best,"You're covering the full brake job. If the rotors are worn, pads alone won't work right. You're helping them think through the whole job.","What year F550?",good,"Year matters for part lookup. Ask about front/rear and rotors to get the complete order.","Sure. Ceramic or semi-metallic? Ceramic is quieter.",better,"Good to offer the upgrade option. Still need to ask front/rear and whether they need rotors.","Front or rear?",good,"Necessary question. Adding the rotor question covers the complete brake job."
February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,16,Counter sale,"I need a seat for my backhoe.","Seats mount on suspension mechanisms. Sometimes the seat is worn but the suspension is fine. Sometimes it's the opposite. Asking clarifies what they actually need.","What model? And is it just the seat, or do you need the suspension too?",best,"This gets to the real need. Maybe the seat cover is torn but the suspension works. Maybe the suspension is shot. Now you know what to quote.","What model backhoe?",good,"Model determines which seat fits. The suspension question helps you quote the right parts.","Cloth or vinyl? Vinyl is easier to clean.",better,"Material choice matters for comfort and durability. Still need model and should ask about suspension.","OEM or aftermarket? OEM fits better but costs more.",good,"Valid options to discuss. Get the model first and ask about suspension to know what you're actually quoting."
February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,17,Phone call,"I need tracks for my CTL.","Tracks are a big purchase. Sprockets and rollers wear with the tracks — if those are worn, the new tracks won't last as long. Worth mentioning.","What model? And while you're doing tracks, do you need sprockets or rollers?",best,"Tracks are expensive. Worn sprockets chew through new tracks faster. Asking helps them get the full value from the new tracks.","What model CTL?",good,"Model is essential. Asking about sprockets and rollers helps them think about the complete undercarriage.","Rubber or steel? Depends on what surfaces you work on.",better,"Good application question. Model first, then track type, then ask about sprockets and rollers.","Those are usually special order. Let me check availability.",good,"Lead time is useful info. Get the model first and ask about the undercarriage components."
February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,18,Counter sale,"I need a hydraulic hose made up.","Hoses fail in pairs — if one is bad, the other has the same hours on it. Worth asking if they want to do both while the machine is down.","Sure. Is it just one hose, or do you want to do the pair while the machine is down?",best,"Hoses in the same circuit wear together. If one failed, the other might be close. Doing both saves a second repair.","Got it. What length and fittings?",good,"You need these specs to make the hose. Asking about the pair might save them downtime later.","Did you bring the old one, or do you have measurements?",better,"Old hose is the easiest way to match it. While you're making it, ask if they want the pair.","What machine is it for? Sometimes we have them pre-made.",good,"Pre-made hoses save time. Still worth asking about the pair — both hoses have the same wear."

Make sure they're included or sold separately — they'll need them for installation.","What year and model?

Either way, they'll have what they need.","What year and model truck?",good,"Year and model get you to the right part. Checking on the gasket makes sure they have everything for install.","Sure. Is the gauge reading wrong, or is it dead completely?",good,"Diagnostic question — sometimes the gauge is the problem.

February 2026,2,Upselling: Building the Order,Turn single parts into complete jobs,20,Counter sale,"I need spark plugs for our generator.","Generators often need plugs, air filter, and oil at the same service interval. If they're doing plugs, they might need the other items too.","What model? And is this a full tune-up, or just plugs?",best,"If it's a tune-up, they probably need air filter and oil too. If it's just plugs, that's fine. Now you know.","What model generator?",good,"Model gets you to the right plugs. Asking about the full tune-up might reveal more they need.","Sure. Want to grab the air filter too? They usually go together.",better,"Good suggestion — air filter and plugs often go together. Getting the model first and asking about the full service covers everything.","How many cylinders?",good,"Cylinder count gives you quantity.
