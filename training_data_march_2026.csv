March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,1,Phone call,"Yeah I need a part.","When a caller is vague, take control by asking a specific question. 'What machine is it for?' gets you started without making them feel interrogated.","What part do you need?",good,"This might get you more info, but vague callers often stay vague. A specific question like 'what machine?' anchors the conversation.","What machine is it for?",best,"This takes control of the call. Once you have the machine, you can guide them through what they need. You're helping them help you.","Can you be more specific?",bad,"This can sound frustrated or impatient. The caller might not know how to be more specific. Give them something concrete to answer.","Let me transfer you to someone who can help.",good,"Sometimes this is necessary, but try to gather basic info first. You might be able to help, and the next person will appreciate having machine info."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,2,Phone call,"I'm not sure what I need. Something's leaking.","Leaks require troubleshooting. Ask WHERE it's leaking to narrow down the system — hydraulic, coolant, fuel, etc. Location tells you what parts to look at.","What color is the fluid?",better,"Color helps identify the system — red/clear is usually hydraulic, green is coolant, diesel smells obvious. Good diagnostic question.","Where on the machine is it leaking from?",best,"Location narrows it down fast. Under the hood vs. under the cab vs. at the boom tells you which system. Then you can ask about color or smell to confirm.","What kind of machine is it?",good,"You need the machine eventually, but 'something's leaking' needs more info first. Location and fluid type help you know what you're looking for.","You'll probably need to bring it in for service.",good,"Sometimes true for complex leaks. But gathering info first — location, fluid type, machine — helps them decide if it's something simple they can fix."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,3,Phone call,"(sounds rushed) I need this part NOW. Do you have it or not?","Rushed callers need efficiency, not pushback. Get the key info fast — part number or machine — then give them a straight answer.","I understand. What's the part number or machine model?",best,"You acknowledged the urgency and asked for exactly what you need. No wasted words. Get the info, check stock, give them an answer.","Okay, calm down. What do you need?",bad,"'Calm down' never calms anyone down. It dismisses their urgency. Stay professional and move quickly to help them.","Let me look that up. Can you hold?",good,"Puts them on hold without getting info first. Get the part number or machine, THEN put them on hold to check. Saves time for both of you.","We're pretty busy right now. Can you call back?",bad,"This loses the sale and damages the relationship. Busy or not, help the customer in front of you (or on the phone)."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,4,Phone call,"I called earlier and talked to someone else. They were supposed to order something.","When following up on someone else's order, get the customer name or account first. You can look up what was discussed and pick up where they left off.","What's your name or account number? I'll pull up the order.",best,"This gets you into the system where you can see what was ordered, when, and the status. You're not starting from scratch.","What did you order?",good,"They might remember, but if the other person took notes in the system, looking it up is faster and more accurate.","Who did you talk to?",good,"Might help you find the order or ask that person. But customer name/account gets you to the same place faster.","I don't see anything. Are you sure you called us?",bad,"This sounds accusatory. Orders get missed sometimes. Start by looking it up properly before suggesting they're wrong."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,5,Phone call,"(background noise, hard to hear) ...filter... machine...","When you can't hear clearly, say so politely and ask them to repeat. Don't guess — wrong parts waste everyone's time.","I'm sorry, I'm having trouble hearing you. Can you say that again?",best,"Honest and polite. Better to ask them to repeat than to guess wrong and order the wrong part.","Did you say fuel filter?",better,"You're confirming what you think you heard. Good if you're pretty sure. If you're not sure at all, just ask them to repeat.","Let me put you on hold while I check.",good,"Check what? You don't have the info yet. Get the details first, then check stock or pricing.","Can you call back from a better location?",good,"Sometimes necessary if it's really bad. But try to get the info first — they might not call back, or they might call a competitor."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,6,Phone call,"I need to check on a warranty claim I submitted.","Warranty claims need to be looked up by customer or claim number. Get the identifier first so you can pull up the details.","What's your name or the claim number?",best,"Gets you into the system to find their specific claim. Then you can give them accurate status information.","When did you submit it?",good,"Helps narrow it down, but name or claim number is more direct. Date is useful if they don't have the claim number.","What was wrong with the part?",good,"Might help you find it, but customer name is faster. The system tracks claims by customer, not by problem description.","Warranty takes 4-6 weeks. Just wait.",bad,"Dismissive and possibly wrong. Look up their specific claim — it might be approved, denied, or need additional info. Give them real status."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,7,Phone call,"Do you guys do hydraulic hoses?","Yes/no questions deserve yes/no answers — then follow up. Don't just say yes and wait. Move the conversation forward.","Yes we do. Do you need one made up?",best,"Answered the question and moved forward. Now you're finding out what they actually need — repair, custom hose, pre-made, etc.","Yes.",good,"Technically correct but dead-ends the conversation. They have to ask the next question. Take the lead.","What kind of hose?",better,"Good follow-up question, but you skipped confirming you do hoses. 'Yes, what kind do you need?' covers both.","Depends. What do you need it for?",good,"'Depends' sounds uncertain. You do make hoses. Say yes, then ask about their specific need."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,8,Phone call,"I bought a part last week and it's not working.","Returns and defective parts need the order pulled up first. Get their name or invoice number to see what they bought and when.","Sorry to hear that. What's your name or invoice number?",best,"Acknowledges the problem and gets you into the system. Once you see the order, you can discuss return, exchange, or troubleshooting.","What's wrong with it?",better,"Good to understand the issue, but you need to find the order first to know what part they have and what the options are.","Did you install it correctly?",bad,"Sounds accusatory. Maybe they did install it wrong, but starting there puts them on the defensive. Look up the order first, then troubleshoot.","We don't do returns on electrical parts.",good,"Might be true for some parts, but you don't know what they bought yet. Look it up first — it might be a different part or qualify for warranty."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,9,Phone call,"What are your hours?","Simple questions deserve simple answers. Give them the info directly, then offer to help with anything else.","We're open 7 to 5, Monday through Friday. Can I help you with anything?",best,"Answered the question and opened the door for more. Maybe they're planning to come in, or maybe they have a parts question too.","What location are you asking about?",better,"Fair question if you have multiple locations. But if it's obvious which one they called, just give the hours.","Check the website.",bad,"Unhelpful and dismissive. You know the hours. Tell them.","7 to 5.",good,"Correct, but incomplete. Days of the week matter. And offering to help with anything else is good customer service."
March 2026,1,Phone Skills,Control the call and gather information efficiently,10,Phone call,"I need to talk to someone in parts.","You ARE someone in parts. Don't transfer unless there's a reason. Find out what they need — you can probably help.","This is parts. What can I help you with?",best,"You identified yourself and moved forward. No unnecessary transfer. You're ready to help.","Speaking. What do you need?",better,"Gets the job done, though 'This is parts, how can I help?' is slightly warmer.","Hold on, let me transfer you.",bad,"Transfer to where? You're in parts. Unless they need someone specific, you should help them.","Who are you looking for?",good,"Sometimes they want a specific person. But if not, this delays helping them. 'This is parts' answers their question."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,11,Counter sale,"(part not in stock) Can you get it?","When you don't have it in stock, immediately pivot to the solution. How fast can you get it? Give them a timeline and an offer to order.","I can have it here tomorrow by 10 AM. Want me to order it?",best,"You turned a stockout into an order. Tomorrow by 10 is specific. They can plan around that. Action-oriented.","Let me check if we can get it.",good,"Shows willingness to help, but 'let me check' leaves them waiting. If you know your lead times, give them an answer.","Sorry, we're out of stock.",bad,"This ends the conversation. No solution, no alternative. The customer leaves with nothing, and you lost a sale.","Try our other location.",good,"Worth mentioning if another branch has it. But check availability first, and offer to order if they'd rather come back to you."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,12,Counter sale,"I need it right now. Can't wait.","When they can't wait, check other branches first. If no one has it, see if there's an alternative part that works.","Let me check what the other branches have. I can tell you who's closest with it in stock.",best,"You're solving the problem. Maybe Cambridge or Dublin has it. Give them options.","There's nothing I can do then.",bad,"There's always something you can do. Check other branches, check for alternates, offer to expedite. Don't give up.","We might have something that'll work. What's it for?",better,"Alternates can save the sale. Make sure it actually works for their application before suggesting it.","Can you wait until tomorrow? I can get it by then.",good,"Worth asking — sometimes 'right now' means 'soon.' But if they truly can't wait, check other locations first."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,13,Phone call,"(part not in stock) Where else can I get it?","If you can't help them, help them find it. Check other SE branches first, then suggest dealers if needed.","Let me check our other locations. I can tell you who has it closest to you.",best,"Keep them in the SE family if possible. Other branches are still SE sales. Help them find it.","Try the dealer.",good,"Dealers are an option, but check SE branches first. We might have it at another location.","I don't know. Maybe online?",bad,"Unhelpful. You have tools to check other locations. Use them before sending the customer elsewhere.","It's on backorder everywhere. Good luck.",bad,"Even if true, this is dismissive. Offer to put them on order and call when it arrives. Stay in the game."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,14,Counter sale,"This is the third time you haven't had what I need.","Repeat stockouts are a relationship issue. Acknowledge it, apologize, and offer a solution. This customer is telling you they might leave.","I'm sorry — that's frustrating. Let me see what we can do to make sure we have what you need in stock.",best,"Acknowledges the pattern, apologizes, and offers to fix it. Maybe they're a candidate for a stocking program or regular order.","What did you need the other times?",better,"Good to understand the pattern. Are they buying things we should stock? But acknowledge the frustration first.","We can't stock everything.",bad,"Defensive and dismissive. They're telling you there's a problem. Listen.","I can order it for you.",good,"Solves today's problem but doesn't address the pattern. They might not come back if this keeps happening."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,15,Phone call,"(critical part, machine down) My excavator is down. I need this part TODAY.","Machine down = money lost. Treat it with urgency. Check all options — stock, other branches, expedited shipping, alternatives.","Let me check everywhere. What's the machine and part so I can see who has it?",best,"Shows urgency matching theirs. You're going to work all options to get them running.","I don't have it. Sorry.",bad,"'Sorry' doesn't fix their excavator. Check other branches, check expedited options, check alternates. Fight for them.","It's a two-day lead time from the warehouse.",good,"That's useful info, but explore other options first. Maybe another branch has it. Maybe there's an alternate.","Can you use an aftermarket part?",better,"Aftermarket can be faster to get. Make sure it works for the application. Good option to explore, but check OEM availability first."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,16,Counter sale,"(looking at empty shelf space) You used to carry these all the time.","Stock levels change, but acknowledge their observation. Explain what you can do now, and consider if this should be restocked.","You're right, we did. Let me order one for you and I'll mention this to the manager — might need to bring them back.",best,"Acknowledges they're right, solves today's problem, and takes action on the bigger issue. Good customer service.","Yeah, we had to cut some stuff.",good,"Honest, but doesn't help them. Order the part and consider whether it should be restocked.","Corporate decides what we stock.",bad,"Deflects responsibility. The customer doesn't care whose decision it was. Help them get the part.","I can order it. Should be here in a couple days.",better,"Solves the immediate problem. Mentioning it to the manager shows you heard their feedback."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,17,Phone call,"I need 10 of these but you only have 3. What can you do?","Partial stock means partial delivery. Offer to ship what you have now and get the rest coming. Don't make them wait for everything.","I can get you the 3 now and have the other 7 here tomorrow. Want me to set that up?",best,"Splits the order so they get started right away. Shows flexibility and problem-solving.","I only have 3.",good,"True but incomplete. What about the other 7? How fast can you get them? Give them the full picture.","You'll have to wait until I can get all 10.",bad,"Why? If they can use 3 now, give them 3 now. Don't make them wait for no reason.","Let me check what other branches have.",better,"Good instinct — another branch might have more. Could combine stock for faster complete delivery."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,18,Counter sale,"(common filter, out of stock) How are you out of oil filters?","Common parts being out of stock is embarrassing. Acknowledge it, solve it, and don't make excuses.","Good question — that shouldn't happen. Let me order it and I'll make sure the manager knows.",best,"Acknowledges the problem without making excuses. Solves it and takes action on the inventory issue.","We sold a lot this week.",good,"Maybe true, but sounds like an excuse. The customer doesn't care why — they care about getting the filter.","I can have it tomorrow.",better,"Solves the problem. Adding 'that shouldn't happen' shows you understand their frustration.","Check back next week.",bad,"A week for an oil filter? That's losing a customer. Order it now, get it tomorrow."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,19,Phone call,"Can you hold one at another branch for me to pick up?","Branch transfers and holds help customers get what they need. Check availability and coordinate.","Let me call them and make sure it's set aside. What name should I put it under?",best,"You're doing the work for them. Call, confirm, put their name on it. Easy pickup for them.","I'll give you their number.",good,"Gives them the info but makes them do the calling. Better to coordinate for them.","You'll have to call them yourself.",bad,"Why? You can make one call and solve it. That's better customer service.","I'm not sure if they can hold parts.",good,"They can. Call and set it up. Don't leave the customer uncertain."
March 2026,2,Handling Stockouts,Keep the sale when the part isn't on the shelf,20,Counter sale,"(discontinued part) They don't make this anymore?","Discontinued parts need alternatives. Know what supersedes it, or find a cross-reference that works.","That one's discontinued, but there's a new part number that replaces it. Let me look it up.",best,"Shows knowledge and immediately offers a solution. Supersession numbers exist for this reason.","Yeah, it's obsolete.",good,"True, but doesn't help them. What's the replacement? That's what they need to know.","You might find one online somewhere.",bad,"Sends them away from you. Check for supersessions or alternatives first. Keep the sale.","When did that happen?",good,"Doesn't matter when. What matters is: what's the replacement? Focus on the solution."
